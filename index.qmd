# Introduction {.unnumbered}

My name is Beatriz Werneck, and I’m an architect and urban planner who graduated from the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG) in Brazil. I’m currently pursuing a Master of Science in Urban Spatial Science at the Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis (CASA), University College London (UCL).

This page is my learning diary for the module Remotely Sensing Cities and Environments. Here, I’ll be sharing weekly posts about the course content and my reflections along the way. I hope you enjoy following this journey!
