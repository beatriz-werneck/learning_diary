# Week 01: Getting started with remote sensing

## Summary

Remote sensing can be defined as the acquisition of information about the Earth from a distance. To collect Earth observation data, sensors are required, which can be classified as either passive or active. Passive sensors rely on naturally available energy, such as sunlight, and include instruments like the human eye, cameras, and optical satellite sensors. In contrast, active sensors provide their own source of energy for illumination, as seen in systems such as Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR).

Both types of sensors operate using electromagnetic (EM) waves, which are generated by vibrating charged particles and travel through the vacuum of space at the constant speed of light. EM waves vary in wavelength and frequency: as frequency and energy increase, wavelength decreases. For example, gamma rays have very short wavelengths and high frequencies, whereas radio waves have long wavelengths and low frequencies. Although all EM waves travel at the same speed, only a small portion of the spectrum is visible to the human eye. Objects appear coloured because they absorb certain wavelengths of visible light and reflect others, with the reflected wavelengths determining the observed colour.

Importantly, all materials on Earth emit, absorb, and reflect EM radiation differently. Understanding these interactions allows us to study environmental phenomena such as vegetation dynamics, seasonal change, surface temperature, material composition, and habitat distribution. When EM energy reaches the Earth’s surface, it is partially absorbed and reflected. Before reaching the sensor, the reflected energy may be scattered or absorbed by atmospheric particles. Factors such as scattering, clouds, polarisation, fluorescence, and the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) can significantly influence the recorded signal.

Shorter wavelengths scatter more easily in the atmosphere, explaining why the sky appears blue. Atmospheric scattering can also obstruct surface observations, particularly due to clouds. Active sensors using longer wavelengths can overcome this limitation, as they are capable of penetrating clouds and other atmospheric disturbances.

Finally, remotely sensed data are characterised by four key resolutions: spatial (pixel size), spectral (number of wavelength bands), temporal (revisit frequency), and radiometric (sensitivity to differences in energy). Environmental conditions and sensor limitations often constrain data choice, making it essential to select appropriate data for specific applications.

## Application 

Remote sensing is widely used to observe and monitor the Earth using spaceborne, airborne, and ground-based sensors, and many studies show how these different platforms are suited to different applications. For example, spaceborne sensors are commonly used to track changes in vegetation over large areas by analysing reflected near-infrared (NIR) radiation, which is strongly related to plant health. This approach is often discussed in the literature in relation to agriculture, deforestation, and seasonal ecosystem changes, as it allows patterns to be observed consistently over time. Airborne sensors, such as those mounted on drones or aircraft, are frequently used when more detailed information is needed, for instance in precision farming or forest management. Ground-based measurements are also important, as they are often used to validate and interpret remotely sensed data, helping to link satellite observations with real conditions on the ground. These examples highlight how practical constraints, such as spatial resolution and coverage, influence the choice of remote sensing data in real applications.

Remote sensing is also widely used in climate and environmental studies, especially to understand how energy moves between the Earth and the atmosphere. This is often described as the radiation budget, which refers to how much energy from the Sun reaches the Earth, how much is reflected back into space, and how much is absorbed and re-emitted as heat. Satellite data help researchers study these energy exchanges, which are important for understanding climate change and temperature patterns. Reflected near-infrared (NIR) waves are particularly useful because healthy vegetation reflects a large amount of NIR energy. By analysing this reflected energy, scientists can easily identify vegetation cover, plant stress, and seasonal changes across large areas. This makes NIR data very valuable for monitoring crops, forests, and ecosystems.

To make sense of the large amount of data collected by sensors, Digital Image Processing (DIP) techniques are used. These methods help clean the data by removing noise, correcting for atmospheric effects, and improving image quality. DIP also allows researchers to highlight specific features, compare images taken at different times, and extract useful information such as land-cover types or changes after extreme events. For example, processed satellite images are often used to map flooded areas, track wildfire damage, or study melting ice. Overall, these concepts show how remote sensing data are transformed into meaningful information that can support environmental studies, decision-making, and practical applications.

## Reflection

Earth Observation (EO) data have strong potential to support environmental policy because they provide consistent, large-scale information about the Earth’s surface. However, integrating EO data into policy is not always straightforward, due to constraints such as limited technical expertise, challenges in interpreting satellite outputs, and gaps between scientific results and policy needs. One important aspect of EO is that different sensors can be selected according to environmental conditions; for example, radar data are often used in regions with frequent cloud cover where optical imagery is unreliable. This demonstrates that EO can be adapted to real-world problems, but only when its limitations are clearly understood. The increasing availability of free satellite data, such as imagery from the Sentinel and Landsat missions, together with online platforms like Google Earth Engine, has made EO more accessible to governments and organisations with limited technical resources. These tools allow users to analyse a wide range of surface changes, including deforestation, flooding, crop conditions, urban expansion, and ship movements, without the need to process raw data from scratch. As a result, EO-based evidence can inform planning decisions and support a more critical evaluation of policy claims based on spatial data.
